Actionable Recommendations
Improve profitability in Delhi: Adjust pricing, optimize costs, or introduce higher-margin products.
Replicate Mumbai’s strategies: Since Mumbai performs well, similar pricing, promotions, and marketing strategies could be applied to Delhi.
Revise pricing for ElectricalSara: Since they place high-volume orders but have a very low profit margin, consider renegotiating terms or offering bundle discounts.
Strengthen relations with Excel Store: Given their profitability, maintain strong engagement and loyalty programs.
